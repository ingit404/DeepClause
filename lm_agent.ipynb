      "\n",
      "**Eligibility of Card-Issuers:**\n",
      "*   Banks with a net worth of ₹100 crore or more are permitted to conduct credit card business, either independently or through tie-ups with other card-issuing banks or NBFCs, with Board approval.\n",
      "*   Banks wishing to establish separate subsidiaries for credit card business require prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Board Approved Policy and Procedures:**\n",
      "*   Each card-issuer must have a well-documented, Board-approved policy for the issuance and conduct of credit cards, consistent with RBI instructions. This policy should be available on the card-issuer's website.\n",
      "*   The policy must cover aspects such as interest rate ceilings, charges, default reporting to Credit Information Companies (CICs), co-branding arrangements, discretionary blocking procedures, timelines for lost card formalities, and grievance redressal.\n",
      "*   Card-issuers must establish a mechanism for half-yearly review of credit card operations by the Audit Committee of the Board, covering customer service, frauds, complaints, and card usage analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Customer Acquisition:**\n",
      "*   Card-issuers must provide a one-page Key Fact Statement with the credit card application, detailing important aspects like interest rates and charges.\n",
      "*   If an application is rejected, the specific reason(s) must be conveyed in writing.\n",

      "*   The MITC and a copy of the signed agreement must be sent to the cardholder's registered email or postal address.\n",
      "*   Card-issuers may offer insurance cover for liabilities from lost cards or card frauds, but explicit written or digital consent, along with nominee details, must be obtained from cardholders.\n",
      "*   The issue of unsolicited cards or card upgradation is strictly prohibited. An unsolicited credit card is one issued without a specific written or digital request or application. However, renewal or replacement of an existing card is not considered unsolicited.\n",
      "*   Consent for cards and associated products/services must be explicit, not implied, and obtained in writing or through digital modes with multifactor authentication.\n",

      "*   Transparency is required for EMI conversions, clearly indicating principal, interest, and upfront discounts.\n",
      "*   Loans offered via credit cards must comply with RBI instructions on loans and advances.\n",
      "*   The sanctioned credit limit must not be breached without explicit consent from the cardholder. Overlimit usage requires prior explicit consent, and cardholders must have the option to enable or disable the overlimit facility. Interest or charges on the card are not factored into credit limit usage for levying overlimit charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Credit Cards:**\n",

      "*   Business credit cards can be issued to business entities/individuals for business expenses, including as charge cards, corporate credit cards, or linked to credit facilities like overdraft/cash credit. An effective mechanism to monitor end-use of funds is required.\n",
      "*   Add-on cards can only be issued to persons identified by the principal cardholder, with liability resting with the principal cardholder. For corporate credit cards, responsibilities and liabilities of the corporate and employees must be clearly specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Terms and Conditions:**\n",
      "*   The contractual terms and conditions governing the issue and use of cards must be provided to cardholders in writing, in clear and simple language (preferably English, Hindi, and local language).\n",

      "*   Convenience fees must be indicated transparently before the transaction.\n",
      "*   Terms must specify timelines for reversal of failed transactions and compensation for delays.\n",
      "*   Changes to terms require 30 days' notice to the cardholder, who is deemed to accept if they do not withdraw within this period. Changes must be notified through all communication channels.\n",
      "*   Cardholders are obligated to keep the card safe and not record PINs/codes accessibly to third parties.\n",
      "*   Card-issuers must exercise care when issuing PINs/codes and not disclose them to anyone other than the cardholder.\n",

      "AI: To issue a credit card, banks must have a net worth of ₹100 crore or more and obtain Board approval to undertake credit card business, either independently or through tie-ups. Establishing separate subsidiaries requires prior approval from the Reserve Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each card-issuer must have a Board-approved policy covering aspects like interest rates, charges, reporting defaults to Credit Information Companies, co-branding, procedures for blocking/deactivating cards, timeframes for lost card formalities, and grievance redressal. Credit card operations must be reviewed half-yearly by the Audit Committee of the Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "During customer acquisition, card-issuers must provide a one-page Key Fact Statement with the application and convey specific reasons for rejection in writing. The Most Important Terms and Conditions (MITC) must be highlighted and sent to customers at acceptance and whenever conditions are modified, preferably in English, Hindi, and the local language. Explicit written or digital consent is required for issuing a credit card, and the issue of unsolicited cards or unsolicited upgradation is strictly prohibited. Card-issuers may offer insurance cover for lost cards/frauds, requiring explicit consent. Telemarketers engaged by card-issuers must comply with regulations and contact customers only between 10:00 hrs and 19:00 hrs. The decision to issue a credit card rests solely with the card-issuer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underwriting standards require card-issuers to prudently assess credit risk and applicants' independent financial means. Credit limits must consider all limits the cardholder has from other entities. Transparency is required for EMI conversions, clearly indicating principal, interest, and discounts. Loans offered through credit cards must comply with Reserve Bank instructions. The sanctioned credit limit cannot be breached without the cardholder's explicit consent, and overlimit charges cannot be levied without such consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Card-issuers can issue credit cards to individuals for personal use (with add-on cards), cards linked to overdraft accounts, and business credit cards to entities/individuals for business expenses. For add-on cards, liability rests with the principal cardholder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between the card-issuer and cardholder is contractual, with clear terms provided in writing. No charges can be levied without explicit indication and consent at the time of issue, except for government-levied taxes. Convenience fees, if any, must be transparently indicated before the transaction. Terms can be altered with 30 days' notice. Cardholders are obligated to keep cards safe, and card-issuers must exercise care when issuing PINs\n",

      "AI: Banks with a net worth of ₹100 crore or more are permitted to issue credit cards in India. They can do this independently or through tie-up arrangements with other card-issuing banks or Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), provided they have Board approval. Setting up separate subsidiaries for credit card business requires prior approval from the Reserve Bank.\n",
